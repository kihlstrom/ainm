# ainm
## Automatic Input Name Model
Ainm automatically creates a model with two-way binding based on input element names in the specified document. In order to display a value in another element use the attribute `data-ainm` with the name of an input element as attribute value.
Example: `<span data-ainm="username"></span>`

As it happens "ainm" means "name" in Irish.
